This is the repository for my course, [PostCSS: First Look](http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Building-Responsive-Single-Page-Design-PostCSS/417644-2.html). The full course is available at [lynda.com](http://lynda.com).

## Course Description
PostCSS is a CSS post-processor engine that allows you to transform regular CSS through JavaScript plugins. Like LESS, Sass, and Stylus, these plugins allow you to use CSS in new and exciting ways like automatically prefixing your CSS for older browsers; adding variables, conditionals, or nesting; and even transpiling next-generation CSS so that it works in older browsers today. PostCSS can be 3â€“30 times faster than other pre-processors and offers a modular approach, so you can install just the plugins you want to use.

In this short course, you'll learn how to set up a workflow for Gulp.js using PostCSS, which can speed up the way you build websites and change the way you write CSS. Author Ray Villalobos will also introduce the most useful PostCSS plugins, including cssnano, Autoprefixer, cssnext, and PreCSS.
